Game Play
Eco Hero is a single player game, with the player starting with three lives and a score of 0. The game has a time limit of 30 seconds, and the player's goal is to sort as many items as possible into the correct categories (recyclable or non-recyclable) in the given time.

An item will appear on the screen and the player can click on either the "Recyclable" or "Non-Recyclable" button to sort it. If the player sorts the item correctly, their score will increase by 1. If the player sorts the item incorrectly, one of their lives will be lost. If the player loses all three lives, the game will be over and the player will be given their final score.
